# def solution(A, B, K)
# that, given three integers A, B and K, returns the number of integers within the range [A..B]
# that are divisible by K, i.e.:
# { i : A â‰¤ i â‰¤ B, i mod K = 0 }
# For example, for A = 6, B = 11 and K = 2, your function should return 3,
# because there are three numbers divisible by 2 within the range [6..11], namely 6, 8 and 10.
# Assume that:
# A and B are integers within the range [0..2,000,000,000];
# K is an integer within the range [1..2,000,000,000];
# A â‰¤ B.
# Complexity:
# expected worst-case time complexity is O(1);
# expected worst-case space complexity is O(1).
# correctnes 100%
# complexity: O(1)
