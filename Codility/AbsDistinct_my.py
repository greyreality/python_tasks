# A non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers is given. The array is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# The absolute distinct count of this array is the number of distinct absolute values among the elements of the array.
# For example, consider array A such that:
# [-5,-3,-1,0,3,6]
#   A[0] = -5
#   A[1] = -3
#   A[2] = -1
#   A[3] =  0
#   A[4] =  3
#   A[5] =  6
# The absolute distinct count of this array is 5, because there are 5 distinct absolute values
# among the elements of this array, namely 0, 1, 3, 5 and 6.
# Write a function:def solution(A)
# that, given a non-empty zero-indexed array A consisting of N numbers, returns absolute distinct count of array A.
# For example, given array A [-5,-3,-1,0,3,6]
# the function should return 5, as explained above.
# Assume that:
# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647];
# array A is sorted in non-decreasing order.
# Complexity:
# expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
# expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
# Detected time complexity: O(N) or O(N*log(N))
# correctness 100%
